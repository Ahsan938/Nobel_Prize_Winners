# Nobel_Prize_Winners
The Nobel Prize stands as one of the globe's most renowned scientific accolades. Beyond the honor, respect, and substantial financial reward it bestows upon its recipients, a distinctive gold medal featuring the likeness of Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896), the visionary behind the prize, is also granted. Each year, this esteemed prize is bestowed upon scientists and scholars in categories spanning chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The inaugural Nobel Prize was distributed in 1901, a time when the prize leaned significantly towards a Eurocentric and male-centric bias. However, contemporary iterations of the prize strive to eliminate biases, aiming for impartiality in all respects.
